Sure, I'll walk you through the linearization process again.

First, let's define our state variables:

    x1: theta, angle provided by an encoder
    x2: theta_dot, derivative of theta
    x3: alpha, second angle provided by a relative encoder
    x4: alpha_dot, derivative of alpha

Our input variable is V, which is the voltage applied to the motor.

The torque equation we have is:
tao = ng * nm * Kt * (V - Km * x2 / Kt) / Rm

We can substitute this equation into our state equations to get:
dx1 = x2
dx2 = (ng * nm * Kt / Jeq) * (V - Km * x2 / Kt) - (Beq / Jeq) * x2 + (BL / Jeq) * x4 - (Ks / Jeq) * sin(x3)
dx3 = x4
dx4 = -(Jeq + JL) / (Jeq * JL) * BL * x4 + Beq / Jeq * x2 - (Jeq + JL) / (Jeq * JL) * Ks * sin(x3) - tao / Jeq

To linearize the system, we need to find the equilibrium point. Let's assume that the equilibrium point is at:

    x1_eq = 0
    x2_eq = 0
    x3_eq = 0
    x4_eq = 0
    V_eq = 0

We can then define small perturbations from this equilibrium point:

    x1 = x1_eq + delta_x1
    x2 = x2_eq + delta_x2
    x3 = x3_eq + delta_x3
    x4 = x4_eq + delta_x4
    V = V_eq + delta_V

Substituting these perturbations into our state equations and taking the first-order Taylor series approximation, we get:
delta_x1_dot = delta_x2
delta_x2_dot = (ng * nm * Kt / Jeq) * delta_V - (ng * nm * Kt * Km / (Jeq * Kt)) * delta_x2 - (Beq / Jeq) * delta_x2 + (BL / Jeq) * delta_x4 - (Ks / Jeq) * delta_x3
delta_x3_dot = delta_x4
delta_x4_dot = -(Jeq + JL) / (Jeq * JL) * BL * delta_x4 + Beq / Jeq * delta_x2 - (Jeq + JL) / (Jeq * JL) * Ks * delta_x3 - (ng * nm * Kt / Jeq) * delta_V

We can write this in matrix form as:
delta_x_dot = A * delta_x + B * delta_V

where:
delta_x = [delta_x1; delta_x2; delta_x3; delta_x4]
A = [0, 1, 0, 0;
-ng * nm * Kt * Km / (Jeq * Kt), -Beq / Jeq, -Ks / Jeq, BL / Jeq;
0, 0, 0, 1;
Beq / Jeq, 0, -Jeq * Ks / (Jeq * JL), -BL * (Jeq + JL) / (Jeq * JL)]
B = [0; ng * nm * Kt / Jeq; 0; -Beq / Jeq]

I hope this explanation helps!
