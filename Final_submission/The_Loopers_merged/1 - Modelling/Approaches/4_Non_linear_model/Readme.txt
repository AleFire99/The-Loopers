There are two main files:

Main_bode.m: is bode plots for linearized model and nonlinear model
main_error.m: is showing linearization error over changing tip angle


Supporting files:
springcomp_double.m: is a function to calculate actual tourque of the system (nonlinear equations)
SpringDiagram: is to plot a freebody diagram for spring
load_mat.m: is a function to collect all data files
