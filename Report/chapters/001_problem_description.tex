\chapter{Problem Description}
\label{cha:problem_description}

    This report will describe the model of the system, our solution and some attempts to describe and control the system.

    The system is composed by a motor's module that provide torque to a turret, above the turret there's a beam which is attached at one of the two edges through a screw to the turret. The beam will follow the movement of the base due to two springs attached between the turret and the beam.

    The system has several interfaces that could be connected to an acquisition system (DAC/ADC + Amplifier) to acquire measurements and provide input signal, the interfaces are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Actuators:
            \subitem Power Supply input of the motor's module (changing the voltage);
        \item Sensors:
            \subitem Incremental Encoder for the position of the turret \wrt to the motor's module;
            \subitem Incremental Encoder for the relative position of the arm \wrt the turret.
    \end{itemize}
    The acquisition system composed by ADC/DAC + Amplifier is already configured, it doesn't require our attention, for this reason it will not treat in this report.

    The main task is to control a low damped system with variable parameters, this goal is divided in sub-tasks to be achieved:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item position control of the top base, with a frequency based approach;
        \item position control of the arm tip, with a frequency based or a state space approach;
        \item position control of the arm tip with uncertainty in the spring stiffness and arm moment of inertia, with a state space approach or other advanced control techniques.
    \end{enumerate}
